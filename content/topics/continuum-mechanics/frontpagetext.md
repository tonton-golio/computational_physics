## The Glacier on Your Doorstep

Right now, as you read this, a massive slab of ice the size of Denmark is sliding into the ocean. Inside it, every tiny piece of ice is pushing and pulling on its neighbors — squeezing here, stretching there, cracking where the stress gets too much. The ice doesn't know it's a glacier. It just follows the rules.

Today we start learning those rules.

Continuum mechanics is the physics of *stuff* — solids that bend and break, fluids that pour and swirl, and everything in between. It's the reason bridges hold up, rivers flow downhill, honey spirals off a spoon, and earthquakes rattle cities hundreds of kilometers from a fault line.

## What You'll Learn

In this course, you'll become fluent in the mechanical behavior of continuous matter — from viscous fluids to elastic solids. We'll build up from first principles:

- **How to describe deformation** — the stress and strain tensors, linear elasticity, and why materials push back when you push them.
- **How to write the equations of motion** — the Navier-Cauchy equation for solids, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for fluids.
- **How to solve them** — analytically for the beautiful simple cases, numerically for everything else.

The emphasis is on real systems: glaciers, oceans, icebergs, earthquakes, cheese. Yes, cheese. You'll see.

## The Philosophy

We won't start with equations. We'll start with *pictures*. Every concept in this course begins with something you can see, touch, or imagine — a rubber band, a block of cheese, a drop of honey. The equations come after, as the punchline to a question you already have.

If at any point the math feels disconnected from reality, stop and go back to the physical picture. The math is the servant of the physics, not the other way around.

## Course Structure

Two mandatory assignments (which don't count toward your grade — they're for your own learning). An oral exam at the end. But the real payoff is this: after this course, you'll never look at a river, a rubber tire, or a cube of cheese the same way again.

Let's begin.
