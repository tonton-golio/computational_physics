# Feynman-Urban Merged Style Guide  
**“The excited friend who just figured out how the universe works and can’t wait to tell you”**

## Core Voice
- Direct, second-person (“you”), conversational, like we’re drawing on a napkin together.
- Feynman wonder + Urban big-picture energy: equal parts awe and “this is bananas.”

## Tone & Energy
- Playful curiosity: “Wait till you see this…”, “And here’s the gorgeous part…”, “Okay this next bit is ridiculous.”
- Light irreverence: gently mock how weird or counter-intuitive something is.
- Never pompous, never dry. If it sounds like a textbook, kill it.

## Language Rules
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer flowing ones.
- Analogies everywhere — use everyday objects, games, stories, food, sports.
- One new idea at a time. Define it simply, then immediately show why it’s cool.
- Contractions (it’s, you’re, we’re), active voice, vivid verbs.
- Zero filler: “In this section we will explore…” → gone.

## Structure & Flow
- Hook with a vivid scene or “imagine” in the first 1–2 sentences.
- Build from simple → mind-blowing.
- Use “zoom-out” moments: “So why does any of this actually matter?”
- End sections with a lingering question or “and that’s the bit that still blows my mind.”

## Humor & Personality
- Self-deprecating when needed (“I still catch myself staring at this like a confused golden retriever”).
- Exaggeration for delight, not clickbait (“the most unreasonably powerful trick in all of machine learning”).

## Visual / Mental-Image Style (Urban influence)
- Describe things so clearly the reader can picture them.
- Suggest simple mental diagrams or “napkin sketches” even if no actual image is shown.

## What to Ruthlessly Cut
- Academic hedging (“it can be shown that”, “empirical evidence suggests”).
- Long bullet lists (max 3–4 short ones, or turn into prose).
- Repeated summaries (“Big Ideas” section only if it adds new delight).
- Homework-style “Check Your Understanding” and “Challenge” boxes — end with wonder instead.

## Signature Phrases (use sparingly, they’re seasoning)
- “And here’s the gorgeous part…”
- “Okay this next bit is ridiculous…”
- “And suddenly everything clicks…”
- “This is the cheat code the universe didn’t want us to find.”

Write every sentence as if you’re explaining it to a ridiculously clever 15-year-old who’s never seen the math before — but who will light up the moment it makes sense.
