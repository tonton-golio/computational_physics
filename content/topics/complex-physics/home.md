# Complex Physics

## Course overview

Complex physics studies systems composed of many interacting components whose collective behavior cannot be predicted from individual parts alone. These systems exhibit **emergent phenomena** such as phase transitions, self-organization, power-law distributions, and fractal geometry.

- Classical physics: few-body systems, exact solutions, linear superposition.
- Complex physics: many-body interactions, statistical descriptions, nonlinear dynamics, universality.

Core approach:

1. Identify the relevant degrees of freedom and their interactions.
2. Use statistical mechanics to connect microscopic rules to macroscopic observables.
3. Recognize universal scaling behavior near critical points.
4. Simulate complex systems computationally when analytical solutions fail.

## Why this topic matters

- Phase transitions underpin phenomena from magnetism to superconductivity.
- Percolation theory models fluid flow through porous media, disease spreading, and network resilience.
- Self-organized criticality explains power laws in earthquakes, forest fires, and biological evolution.
- Network science describes the structure of the internet, social systems, and gene regulation.
- Agent-based models capture emergent collective behavior from simple local rules.
- Econophysics applies statistical mechanics to financial markets and wealth distributions.

## Key mathematical ideas

- Partition functions, free energy, and thermodynamic observables.
- Order parameters, critical exponents, and scaling relations.
- Renormalization group and universality classes.
- Power-law distributions and fractal dimensions.
- Monte Carlo sampling and Markov chain methods.
- Graph theory and network metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Probability and statistical reasoning.
- Calculus and linear algebra.
- Basic thermodynamics and classical mechanics.
- Familiarity with Python for computational exercises.

## Learning trajectory

This module is organized from equilibrium foundations to complex emergent behavior:

- Statistical mechanics: ensembles, partition functions, and the Ising model.
- Phase transitions: mean-field theory, Monte Carlo simulation, order parameters.
- Critical phenomena: universality, scaling laws, renormalization group.
- Percolation and fractals: connectivity thresholds, fractal dimension, self-similarity.
- Self-organized criticality: sandpile models, avalanches, power-law distributions.
- Networks: graph metrics, scale-free structures, dynamics on networks.
- Agent-based models: stochastic simulation, Gillespie algorithm, cellular automata.
- Econophysics: Brownian motion in markets, Hurst exponent, bet hedging.
