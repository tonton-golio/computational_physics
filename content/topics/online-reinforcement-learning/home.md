# Online and Reinforcement Learning

Imagine two weather forecasters who never look out the window. Forecaster A always says "Rain." Forecaster B always says "Sunny." After a thousand days, which one was better? You can't know until you check.

But here's the trick. Each morning, you look at both track records and lean toward whoever's been right most often. Day by day, your cumulative mistakes grow *slower* than the best single forecaster's. That gap between your total loss and the best expert's total loss? That's **regret**. Making it grow as slowly as possible is the entire game of online learning.

That idea is the thread running through everything here. We start with regret, learn algorithms that minimize it, move to slot machines where you only see one outcome at a time, and then enter the full world of reinforcement learning where your actions change the world around you.

Spam filters, doctors, robots, stock traders -- every one of them is playing this exact game right now.
