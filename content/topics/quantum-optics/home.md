# Quantum Optics

## Course overview

Quantum optics studies the **quantum mechanical aspects of the interaction between light and matter**. Unlike classical optics, where electromagnetic fields are treated as continuous waves, quantum optics reveals the discrete photon nature of light and the fundamentally quantum phenomena that arise from field quantization.

- Classical optics: continuous electromagnetic waves, intensity, interference.
- Quantum optics: photon concept, field quantization, vacuum fluctuations, non-classical correlations.

Core conceptual framework:

1. Quantize the electromagnetic field to obtain photon number (Fock) states.
2. Construct coherent states that bridge quantum and classical descriptions.
3. Measure field correlations through photo-detection to reveal quantum coherence.
4. Analyze input/output devices (beam splitters, interferometers) quantum mechanically.
5. Study atom-field interactions, spontaneous emission, and cavity QED.
6. Explore non-classical states: squeezed light, entangled photons, cat states.

## Why this topic matters

- Quantum communication and quantum key distribution.
- Precision metrology and gravitational wave detection (squeezed light at LIGO).
- Quantum computing with photonic platforms and cavity QED.
- Fundamental tests of quantum mechanics (Bell inequalities, entanglement).
- Single-photon sources and detectors for quantum networks.
- Laser physics and coherence theory.

## Key mathematical ideas

- Harmonic oscillator algebra: creation and annihilation operators.
- Coherent states as displaced vacuum and minimum-uncertainty states.
- Quasi-probability distributions: Wigner, P, and Q functions in phase space.
- Field correlation functions and quantum coherence hierarchy.
- Jaynes-Cummings model and dressed states for atom-field coupling.
- Squeezing operators and uncertainty engineering.

## Prerequisites

- Quantum mechanics (Dirac notation, operators, commutators).
- Electrodynamics (Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves).
- Linear algebra (eigenvalues, Hilbert spaces).
- Basic probability and statistics.
