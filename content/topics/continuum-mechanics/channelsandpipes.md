# Channels and Pipes

## Channels and Pipes
For steady flows, the navier stokes equation becomes;
$$
EQ 16.1
$$
From this we can derive assuming steady flow and imcompressible liquid, we get __pressure driven channel flow__ between two plates, the velocity field is given as
$$
v_x=\frac{G}{2 \eta}(a^2-y^2)
$$
So the velocity profile at one point between the plates is a parabella.
For shear thickening material this shape will be more "sharp", for the opposite case it will be more square
__INCLUDE PICTURE__
Also works for other materials than water, ie. glaciers have $n>1$ and its profile is more square.

Reynolds number comment include.

__Gravity-driven planar flow__
Imagine two incline planes where gravity acts on the body of the water (Think Cauchys EQ.)
the solution then becomes
$$
0=g_y - \frac{\nabla_y p}{\rho}\hspace{4mm}0 = g_x + \mu \frac{\partial^2v_x}{\partial y^2}
$$
Observing the profile like above allows one to estimate the power flow law exponent $n$.
For $n=1$ the solution is a parabella
$$
v_x=\frac{g_0 sin(\theta)}{2\mu}(a^2+y^2)
$$

__Laminar pipe flow__
for laminar pipe flow we have the velocity profile
$$
v_z = \frac{G}{4\eta}(a^2-r^2) \hspace{4mm} EQ 16.29
$$
$$
Q=\
$$


$$
EQ 16.29 + 16.39 + 16.32 + \text{SEE SLIDES FROM ABSA}
