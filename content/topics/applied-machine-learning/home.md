# Applied Machine Learning

## Course overview

Applied machine learning studies how to design models that generalize well to new data while remaining computationally practical. This module emphasizes intuition through losses, optimization, representation learning, and graph-structured data.

- Loss functions and optimization: how models learn from data.
- Tree-based and ensemble methods: strong baselines for structured data.
- Dimensionality reduction: compressing and visualizing high-dimensional spaces.
- Graph and sequence models: extending ML to relational and temporal data.

## Why this topic matters

- Machine learning drives modern scientific discovery, from molecular property prediction to climate modeling.
- Understanding loss functions and optimization dynamics is essential for training any model effectively.
- Tree ensembles remain the strongest baselines for tabular data across many domains.
- Dimensionality reduction is critical for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- Graph neural networks open ML to relational data that cannot be expressed as flat tables.

## Key concepts

- Loss functions encode modeling goals for classification and regression.
- Optimization dynamics (learning rate, momentum, adaptivity) determine training outcomes.
- Decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting capture nonlinear interactions.
- PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP reveal structure in high-dimensional data.
- Graph neural networks learn on relational data through message passing.
- Recurrent architectures handle sequential dependencies.
- Generative adversarial networks bridge classical ML and deep generative modeling.
