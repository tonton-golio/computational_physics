# Quantum Optics



# __Contents__
- The course introduces quantum optics, i.e. **the quantum mechanical aspects** of the interaction between light and matter.
- The photon concept is introduced with **the quantization of the free electromagnetic field** and the role of boundary conditions is analyzed.
- Measurement of **field correlation properties** by photo-detection are discussed, and simple input/output systems are analyzed.
- **Quantum properties of light**, such as photon anti-bunching, two-photon interferometry, squeezed, and entangled states of light are discussed.
- **Spontaneous emission** is treated by semi-classical perturbation theory and by quantum optical methods forming the basis for a description of cavity quantum electrodynamics.
- **Rabi oscillations** for a 2-level emittter driven by a strong laser fields are analyzed and several applications of quantum optics in quantum communication and quantum measurements are discussed.

# __Other useful webpage for quantum optics__
- For general introduction [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optics) but ch.1 of Gerry-Knight textbook is original.
- My personal recommendation is YouTube channel [@ProfessorMdoesScience](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorMdoesScience). I learned basic stuff here.
