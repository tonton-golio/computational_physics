# Percolation and Fractals

## Percolation Theory

Percolation theory studies the connectivity of random media. In site percolation, each site (lattice point) is occupied with probability $p$, and we study when the system percolates (has a connected path from one side to the other).

## Fractals

Fractals are complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They often arise in percolation clusters at criticality.
