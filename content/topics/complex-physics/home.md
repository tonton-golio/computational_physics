# Complex Physics

Imagine you are watching a pot of water boil. Why does heat spread evenly? Why do molecules share energy the way they do? That is statistical mechanics. Now ask: what happens when everything suddenly changes, when a magnet loses its magnetism or a liquid becomes a gas? Those are phase transitions, and they are among the most dramatic events in nature.

Here is where it gets truly beautiful. Completely different systems -- magnets, fluids, gases -- all behave *identically* near their critical points. That is universality. The same patterns keep showing up: in percolation, when a connected path suddenly spans a random medium; in self-organized criticality, when a sandpile tunes itself to the edge of chaos; in networks, when the rich get richer and power laws emerge; in agent-based models, when dumb local rules produce smart global behavior; even in financial markets, when stock prices crash like avalanches.

Nature reuses her tricks. Complex physics is about learning what those tricks are.

## Why This Topic Matters

- Phase transitions underpin phenomena from magnetism to superconductivity.
- Percolation theory models fluid flow through porous media, disease spreading, and network resilience.
- Self-organized criticality explains power laws in earthquakes, forest fires, and biological evolution.
- Network science describes the structure of the internet, social systems, and gene regulation.
- Agent-based models capture emergent collective behavior from simple local rules.
- Econophysics applies statistical mechanics to financial markets and wealth distributions.
