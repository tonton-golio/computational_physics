# Coherent States: Displacement, Generation, and Properties

## Displaced vacuum states
Actually, there are three ways to define the coherent state.
* Right eigenstates of the annihilation operator
* States that minimize the uncertainty relation for the two orthogonal field quadratures (which we didn't do)
* Displaced vacuum state

This displacing method is closely related to a mechanism for
generating the coherent state from classical currents.

The displacement operator is defined as
$$
    \hat{D}(\alpha)
    =
    e^{\alpha \hat{a}^\dag - \alpha^* \hat{a}}
$$
And coherent state given as
$$
    \Ket{\alpha}
    =
    \hat{D}
    \Ket{0}
$$

## Wave packets and time evolution
$$
    \hat{q}
    \Ket{q}
    =
    q
    \Ket{q}
$$
$$
    \left| \psi_\alpha (q) \right|
    =
    \left| \Braket{q|\alpha} \right|^2
$$
This is Gaussian.
Quantum fluctuation is constant with time.


## Generation of coherent states
Coherent state can be generated by classically oscillating thing.

* Orthogonal $\Braket{n|n^\prime} = \delta_{nn^\prime}$
* Complete $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\Ket{n}\Bra{n} = 1$
### Properties of coherent state
##### Orthogonality
Let's check the orthogonality.
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Braket{\beta|\alpha}
    &=
    e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}}
    e^{-\frac{|\beta|^2}{2}}
    \sum_{n=0}^\infty
    \frac
    { {\beta^*}^n \alpha^n }
    {n!}
    \\&=
    e^{-\frac{|\alpha|^2}{2}}
    e^{-\frac{|\beta|^2}{2}}
    e^{
    {\beta^* \alpha}
    }
    \\&=
    e^{\frac{1}{2}(\beta^*\alpha - \beta\alpha^*)}
    e^{-\frac{1}{2}|\beta^2 - \alpha^2|}
    \\& \neq
    0
\end{aligned}
$$
So coherent states are not orthogonal.
If $\left| \beta - \alpha \right|$ is large, they are nearly orthogonal.
##### Completeness
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int \Ket{\alpha} \Bra{\alpha} \mathrm{d}^2 \alpha
    &=
    \int \mathrm{d}^2 \alpha
    e^{-|\alpha|^2}
    \sum_{n, n^\prime}
    \frac{\alpha^n {\alpha^*}^n}{\sqrt{n!m!}}
    \Ket{n} \Bra{m}
    \\&=
    \sum_{n, m}
    \frac{\Ket{n} \Bra{m}}{\sqrt{n!m!}}
    \int \mathrm{d}^2 \alpha
    e^{-|\alpha|^2}
    \alpha^n {\alpha^*}^n
    \\&=
    \sum_{n, m}
    \frac{\Ket{n} \Bra{m}}{\sqrt{n!m!}}
    \int \int \mathrm{d}r \mathrm{d}\theta
    r
    e^{-r^2}
    r^{n+m}
    e^{i\theta(n-m)}
    \\&=
    \sum_{n}
    \frac{\Ket{n} \Bra{n}}{n!}
    \int \mathrm{d}r
    r^{2n+1}
    e^{-r^2}
    2\pi
    \\&=
    \sum_{n}
    \Ket{n} \Bra{n}
    \\&=
    \pi
\end{aligned}
$$
We changed the variable $\alpha=re^{i\theta}$,
so integration became $\mathrm{d}^2\alpha = r\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}\theta$.
Also, we used the Dirac delta function
$$
    \int_0^{2\pi}
    \mathrm{d}\theta
    e^{i\theta (n-m)}
    =
    2\pi
    \delta_{nm}
$$

Thus, coherent states is non-orthogonal states and it has a kind of overcomplete property.

## Big Ideas

* Coherent states can be generated from the vacuum by the displacement operator $\hat{D}(\alpha) = e^{\alpha\hat{a}^\dagger - \alpha^*\hat{a}}$ — physically, this corresponds to driving the cavity with a classical oscillating current.
* Coherent states are not orthogonal: $|\langle\beta|\alpha\rangle|^2 = e^{-|\beta-\alpha|^2}$, so two coherent states are nearly orthogonal only when they are well separated in phase space.
* Despite the non-orthogonality, the coherent states form an overcomplete set with $\frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2\alpha\, |\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha| = \hat{I}$, which makes them enormously useful for calculations.
* The wave function $\psi_\alpha(q) = \langle q|\alpha\rangle$ is a Gaussian that moves without spreading — a coherent state is a quantum wave packet that behaves like a classical particle.

## What Comes Next

We now have a complete algebraic and geometric picture of coherent states. The natural next step is to visualize quantum states in general — not just coherent states but thermal states, number states, and stranger beasts — using phase-space pictures. The next lesson introduces the idea of representing a quantum state as a distribution over the complex phase-space plane, which brings us to the quasi-probability distributions.

## Check Your Understanding

1. The displacement operator $\hat{D}(\alpha)$ is unitary. What does unitarity guarantee about the state $|\alpha\rangle = \hat{D}(\alpha)|0\rangle$ compared to the vacuum, and why is it reassuring that the operation is unitary?
2. Coherent states are overcomplete: the resolution of identity requires dividing by $\pi$, so $\frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2\alpha\, |\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha| = \hat{I}$. Why does overcompleteness mean you cannot expand an arbitrary state in the coherent basis in a unique way, and is this a problem in practice?
3. The overlap $|\langle\beta|\alpha\rangle|^2 = e^{-|\beta-\alpha|^2}$ shows coherent states become nearly orthogonal when $|\beta-\alpha| \gg 1$. Interpret this geometrically: what does the distance $|\beta-\alpha|$ represent in terms of the field amplitudes of the two states?

## Challenge

The displacement operator satisfies $\hat{D}^\dagger(\alpha)\hat{a}\hat{D}(\alpha) = \hat{a} + \alpha$. Use this to show that if $|\psi\rangle$ is any state, then $\hat{D}(\alpha)|\psi\rangle$ has its mean quadrature values shifted by $\text{Re}(\alpha)$ and $\text{Im}(\alpha)$ respectively, while all variances and higher cumulants are unchanged. This proves that displacement is a rigid translation in phase space. Then verify this for the specific case $|\psi\rangle = |n\rangle$ by computing $\langle\hat{X}_1\rangle$ and $\langle(\Delta\hat{X}_1)^2\rangle$ before and after displacement.
