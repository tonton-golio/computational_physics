# Applied Statistics

## Course overview

Applied statistics focuses on **practical statistical analysis** through project-based learning. Students conduct statistical projects related to experiments or investigations, preferably using real data, while building fluency in the methods that underpin modern data analysis.

- Classical statistics: estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals.
- Applied statistics: model selection, validation, interpretation, and communication of results.
- Emphasis on understanding when each method is appropriate and what its assumptions require.

## Why this topic matters

- Every experimental science relies on statistical reasoning to distinguish signal from noise.
- Choosing the wrong test or violating assumptions leads to false conclusions.
- Modern datasets require regression, ANOVA, mixed models, and longitudinal methods.
- Statistical literacy is essential for reading and producing scientific literature.

## Key mathematical ideas

- Probability distributions and likelihood functions.
- Parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests.
- Linear models: regression, ANOVA, and their generalizations.
- Random effects and hierarchical/mixed models.
- Experimental design: randomization, blocking, and power analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Introductory statistics: variation, estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests.
- One-way ANOVA and simple linear regression.
- Basic familiarity with R or RStudio.

## Recommended reading

- Draper and Smith, *Applied Regression Analysis*.
- Agresti, *Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences*.
- Course notes and R documentation.

## Learning trajectory

This module progresses from foundational concepts to advanced modeling:

- Introduction and general concepts: central tendency, variability, correlation, and linear regression.
- Probability density functions: distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and the likelihood ratio test.
- Central limit theorem and error propagation.
- Chi-square method: fitting with uncertainties, goodness of fit, and reporting errors.
- Hypothesis testing: t-tests, non-parametric tests, confidence intervals, and Simpson's paradox.
- Simulation and fitting: random number generation, transformation and accept-reject methods.
- ANOVA: one-way, two-way, factorial designs, post-hoc tests, and non-parametric alternatives.
- Design of experiments: randomization, blocking, and power analysis.
- Random effects and mixed models: ICC, variance components, and clustered data.
- Longitudinal data and repeated measures: growth curves, autocorrelation, and missing data.
- Bayesian statistics and multivariate analysis: Bayes' theorem and the Fisher discriminant.
- Advanced fitting and calibration: profile likelihood, model comparison, and systematic uncertainties.
- Machine learning and data analysis: classification, regression, neural networks, and model evaluation.
