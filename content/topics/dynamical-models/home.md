# Dynamical Models in Molecular Biology

Imagine a bacterium so small you need a microscope to see it. It can smell a food gradient weaker than one extra molecule per cell volume -- and it swims toward it. How? With differential equations, noise, and a few molecular tricks that evolution polished for four billion years. Let's dive in.

You'll start with the simplest equation you can write down -- molecules appearing and disappearing -- and build from there. Smooth deterministic equations show you the clockwork. Shake the clockwork and discover that noise isn't a bug but a feature. Add feedback and suddenly cells can remember, decide, and keep time. Zoom out to networks and signals. And at the end, put it all together in a growing bacterium that turns physics into life.

## Why This Topic Matters

* Differential equations and stochastic simulation let you predict how gene circuits behave before building them in the lab.
* Feedback motifs -- switches, oscillators, filters -- are the design principles behind synthetic biology.
* Noise in gene expression explains why genetically identical cells can make different life-or-death decisions.
* Resource allocation models connect single-cell physiology to bacterial growth rate, antibiotic resistance, and infection dynamics.
