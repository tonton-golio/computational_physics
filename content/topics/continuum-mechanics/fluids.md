# Fluids



## __Introduction__
In physics, a fluid is a liquid, gas, or other material
that continuously deforms (flows) under an applied shear
stress, or external force. They have zero shear modulus,
or, in simpler terms, are substances which cannot resist
any shear force applied to them.
Fluids display properties such as:
1. Lack of resistance to permanent deformation
2. Resisting only relative rates of deformation in a dissipative, frictional manner
3. The ability to flow (also described as the ability to
take on the shape of the container).

These properties are typically a function of their inability to support a shear stress in static equilibrium. In
contrast, solids respond to shear either with a spring-
like restoring force, which means that deformations are
reversible, or they require a certain initial stress before
they deform (known as plasticity).
Solids respond with restoring forces to both shear
stresses and to normal stresses both compressive and
tensile. In contrast, ideal fluids only respond with restoring forces to normal stresses, called pressure: fluids can
be subjected to both compressive stress, corresponding
to positive pressure, and to tensile stress, corresponding
to negative pressure. Both solids and liquids also have
tensile strengths, which when exceeded in solids makes irreversible deformation and fracture, and in liquids causes
the onset of cavitation.
Both solids and liquids have free surfaces, which cost
some amount of free energy to form. In the case of solids,
the amount of free energy to form a given unit of surface
area is called surface energy, whereas for liquids the same
quantity is called surface tension. The ability of liquids
to flow results in different behaviour in response to surface tension than in solids, although in equilibrium both
will try to minimise their surface energy: liquids tend
to form rounded droplets, whereas pure solids tend to
form crystals. Gases do not have free surfaces, and freely
diffuse.

## __Buoyancy and Stability__
A body will exhibit the phenomena of weight, if placed in a gravitational field. This force is given as
$$
\mathbf{F}_G = \int_V \rho_{body} \mathbf{g}\hspace{0.2cm}dV
$$
When a body is submerged into a fluid such as water or air, the pressure from that fluid will act on the surface of the body causing a buoyancy effect. The force is given as
$$
\mathbf{F}_B = - \oint_S p\hspace{0.2cm} d\mathbf{S}
$$
Putting them together reproduces Archimedes Principle:
$$
\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}_G + \mathbf{F}_B =\int_V (\rho_{body}-\rho_{fluid})\mathbf{g}\hspace{0.2cm}dV
$$
\emph{The force of buoyancy is equal and opposite to the weight of the displaced fluid}\\
If the gravitational field can be assumed constant in the body, the equation simplifies to
$$
\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}_G + \mathbf{F}_B =(M_{body}-M_{fluid})\mathbf{g}_0
$$

Beyond the buoyant equilibrium, for a floating body to be in total equilibrium, there must also be a balance of moments acting on the body. Similar to above, the contribution of buoyancy and gravity can be expressed as
$$
\mathbf{M}_G = \int_V \mathbf{x}\times \rho_{body} \mathbf{g}\hspace{2mm}dV,\hspace{1cm}\mathbf{M}_B = \oint_S  \mathbf{x}\times (-p) \hspace{2mm}dV
$$
Since these must be equal to be in total equilibrium we have
$$
\mathbf{M}_B=-\mathbf{M}_G
$$
Reproducing the moment equivalent to Archimedes Principle\\
\emph{The moment of buoyancy is equal and opposite to the moment of weight of the displaced fluid}\\

In a constant gravitational field the equations simplifies by introducing the center of gravity $\mathbf{x}_G$ and the center of buoyancy $\mathbf{x}_B$ as

$$
\mathbf{M}_G=\mathbf{x}_G\times M \mathbf{g}_0,\hspace{0.5cm}\mathbf{x}_G=\frac{1}{M}\int_V \mathbf{x}\rho_{body}\hspace{2mm}dV
$$
$$
\mathbf{M}_B=-\mathbf{x}_B\times M \mathbf{g}_0,\hspace{0.5cm}\mathbf{x}_B=\frac{1}{M}\int_V \mathbf{x}\rho_{fluid}\hspace{2mm}dV
$$
$$
\mathbf{M}_{total}=(\mathbf{x}_G - \mathbf{x}_B)\times M\mathbf{g}_0
$$
