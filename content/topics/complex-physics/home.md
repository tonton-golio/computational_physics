# Complex Physics

Picture a pot of water boiling on the stove. Why does the heat spread so evenly? Why do the molecules suddenly decide to dance together when the magnet loses its magnetism? That, my friend, is the magic we're about to explore.

Here's where it gets truly beautiful. Completely different systems -- magnets, fluids, gases -- all behave *identically* near their critical points. That's universality. The same patterns keep showing up: in percolation, when a connected path suddenly spans a random medium; in self-organized criticality, when a sandpile tunes itself to the edge of chaos; in networks, when the rich get richer and power laws emerge; in agent-based models, when dumb local rules produce smart global behavior; even in financial markets, when stock prices crash like avalanches.

Nature reuses her tricks. Complex physics is about learning what those tricks are.

## Why This Topic Matters

Phase transitions underpin everything from magnetism to superconductivity -- and the gorgeous part is that the same math describes them all. Percolation theory tells you how water flows through rock, how diseases spread through populations, and when a network falls apart. Self-organized criticality explains why earthquakes, forest fires, and even biological evolution all produce the same power-law statistics -- nature keeps tuning herself to the edge. Network science gives you the skeleton of the internet, social systems, and gene regulation. Agent-based models show you how dumb local rules create smart global patterns. And econophysics? It turns out stock markets crash like sandpiles avalanche. The tools you'll build here work everywhere.
