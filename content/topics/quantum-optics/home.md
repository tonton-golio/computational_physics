# Quantum Optics

Shine a flashlight at a wall. Classical physics says you are sending a continuous wave of energy, smooth and unbroken, like water from a hose. Turn the brightness down — way down — and classical physics still says the same thing: a dimmer wave, but still continuous. Now put a perfect detector in that beam. What you actually hear is click... click... click. Individual events, spaced randomly, arriving one at a time. Light is not a wave when you catch it. It is a grain. A photon.

That single fact — light arrives in quanta — rewrites everything. A beam splitter does not just divide intensity; it puts a single photon into a superposition of two paths at once. Two photons born together from one crystal can be entangled, their polarizations correlated in ways that no classical signal can explain. Squeeze the quantum noise in one direction of the electromagnetic field and you can measure a signal more precisely than the vacuum itself would seem to allow. LIGO does exactly this to detect gravitational waves that stretch space by less than a thousandth the width of a proton.

Quantum optics is where the weirdness of quantum mechanics becomes not just observable, but useful. Every photon you manipulate is a qubit you can send down a fiber, a sensor that beats the classical limit, or a test of whether reality is as strange as the equations insist.

## Why This Topic Matters

- Quantum key distribution enables communication that is provably secure against eavesdropping.
- Squeezed light at LIGO and Virgo pushes gravitational-wave detection beyond the quantum noise floor.
- Photonic platforms and cavity QED are leading architectures for scalable quantum computing.
- Single-photon sources and detectors form the backbone of emerging quantum networks.
- Bell-inequality experiments with entangled photons provide the most direct tests of quantum mechanics itself.
- Coherence theory underpins every laser, from eye surgery to telecommunications.
